Hi 7102, Your credit score result is "Standard".

The reason for your standard credit score is a combination of several factors.  While your credit history shows some positive aspects, there are areas that could be improved. For example, your relatively high number of delayed payments negatively impacted your score.  Similarly, your current total debt and relatively low monthly investment amount also contributed to this classification. Conversely, a positive factor influencing your score is your credit mix.  Finally, factors such as your annual income, interest rate, and payment of minimum amount also played a role in your overall score.

To improve your credit score to "Good" in the future, consider focusing on these key areas:

**Option 1 (Focus on Income and Debt Management):**

Increasing your annual income significantly improves your creditworthiness.  The model shows that a higher income leads to a better classification. Also, you need to actively reduce your total debt. A substantial decrease in your total debt would positively impact your score.  This would involve either paying down existing debts aggressively or securing better financing options to lower monthly payments. Finally, increasing the amount of money you invest monthly also helps.

**Option 2 (Focus on Timely Payments and Debt Consolidation):**

Reducing the number of times you've been late on payments is critical.  The model highlights the impact of delayed payments on your score.  Aim for consistently on-time payments.  Also, consider debt consolidation. While this might not be recommended without further review and guidance by a financial expert, consolidating several high-interest debts into one loan with a lower interest rate could alleviate financial stress and improve your score.

**Option 3 (Focus on Financial Practices):**

While the above two options give the most weight in influencing the credit score, improving your financial practices would also help long-term.  Increasing the amount invested monthly and decreasing monthly expenses will improve your credit score and overall financial health. You should seek expert financial advice.
