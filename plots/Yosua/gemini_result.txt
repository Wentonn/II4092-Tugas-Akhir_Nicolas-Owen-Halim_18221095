Hi Yosua, Your credit score result is "Bad".

The reason for your "Bad" classification is a combination of several factors.  Our analysis shows that a high interest rate on your existing loans and a less-than-ideal credit mix significantly impacted your score.  Additionally, your relatively high number of credit inquiries and a somewhat low credit history age also contributed to the result. While some aspects of your financial profile were positive (like having several accounts and a moderate level of investment), these positives were outweighed by the negative factors mentioned above.

To improve your credit score in the future, we suggest focusing on the following areas based on our assessment:


**Option 1 (Counterfactual #1):**  This option focuses on reducing your interest rates and improving your credit mix.  Consider refinancing your loans to secure lower interest rates.  This single action can significantly improve your credit score. Simultaneously, work towards improving your credit mix. This involves strategically managing your credit accounts, which might include paying off high-interest debts first, and building up a history with loans such as a Debt Consolidation Loan.  Diversifying your credit profile (having a good mix of credit cards and loans) helps improve your creditworthiness.


Option 3 (Counterfactual #3) presents a more significant change that involves taking on additional loans in an attempt to increase the number of open credit lines, leading to a better credit mix. While counterintuitive, having diverse credit lines is a positive factor. However, this method requires careful financial planning to manage the increased debt responsibility.  It should only be pursued if you can comfortably afford and manage the new loan payments without increasing your existing debt, along with consistently making on-time payments.




We understand that improving your credit score takes time and effort. By focusing on these suggestions, you can work toward a better credit profile.  Thank you for applying for credit with us; we hope you have a great time!
