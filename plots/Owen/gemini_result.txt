Hi Owen, Your credit score result is "Standard".

The reason for your standard credit score is a complex interplay of several factors.  While some aspects of your financial profile are positive, others need improvement.  For example, your interest rate and number of loans positively influenced your score.  However, your monthly balance and outstanding debt negatively impacted it.  A low credit mix and low payment of minimum amount also contributed negatively.  Furthermore, your total debt and several other aspects of your credit history show that there is room for improvement.

To improve your credit score to "Good" in the future, focus on these key areas:

**Group 1: Increasing Income and Managing Expenses**

* **Increase your monthly inhand salary:**  Consider seeking a higher-paying job or exploring additional income streams.  A significant increase in your monthly income (from your current level to approximately $6444) could substantially improve your creditworthiness.  
* **Manage your monthly expenses:**  Reducing your current monthly expenses significantly (from approximately $105 to $778) could free up more money and demonstrate better financial management.  This would also result in an increase in the amount you can pay towards your debt.

**Group 2: Debt Management and Credit Card Usage**

* **Reduce your total number of credit cards:** Lowering your credit card count (from 3 to 2) can help streamline your finances and potentially reduce the risk of overspending.
* **Maintain a good credit utilization ratio:** While you are slightly above the threshold currently, aiming for a better credit utilization ratio (around 42%)  would further improve your credit health.


**Group 3: Addressing Outstanding Debt**

* **Reduce outstanding debt:**  Lowering your outstanding debt (from approximately $1443 to $836)  will significantly improve your credit score. This will greatly reduce your financial burden and also improve your ability to manage other loans.
* **Increase payments towards your loans**: A payment of $1758 toward your Total EMI per month would drastically improve your score. 


By focusing on these adjustments, you can significantly enhance your financial standing and achieve a "Good" credit score.  Remember, consistent responsible financial behavior is key to long-term credit health.
