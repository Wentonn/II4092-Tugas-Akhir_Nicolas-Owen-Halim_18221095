Hi Samuel, Your credit score result is "Standard".

The reason for your standard credit score is a combination of several factors. While some aspects of your financial profile are positive, others need improvement.  For example, your interest rate and credit mix seem to be contributing positively to your score.  Similarly, your total EMI per month and amount invested monthly show some positive influence. However, areas like your outstanding debt, credit history age, and the number of delayed payments are negatively impacting your score.  A higher credit utilization ratio also played a role in your current classification.


To improve your credit score to "Good" in the future, we recommend focusing on the following changes:

**Option 1:** This option focuses on reducing the number of delayed payments and increasing your monthly income/balance. This will help you demonstrate responsible financial management.  You need to reduce your delayed payments to 4 from 13 and increase your total monthly EMI.

**Option 2:** This option builds upon Option 1. In addition to reducing delayed payments, it significantly increases your monthly income and reduces your monthly expenses. This option could improve your creditworthiness as long as you continue paying your loans.

**Option 3:** Similar to Option 2, this focuses on increasing your total EMI per month while also decreasing monthly expenses and maintaining a reasonable monthly balance.  This shows a commitment to debt repayment.

**Option 4:** This is similar to Options 2 and 3, concentrating on increasing your monthly EMI and reducing expenses.


Remember that consistently managing your finances responsibly – paying bills on time, keeping your credit utilization low, and maintaining a healthy savings balance – will all contribute to a better credit score over time.

Thank you for applying for credit with us. We hope you have a great day!
