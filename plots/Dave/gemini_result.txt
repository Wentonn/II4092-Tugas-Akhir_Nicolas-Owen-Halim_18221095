Hi Dave, Your credit score result is "Good".

The model indicates that your credit score is good.  Several factors contributed positively to this assessment, including a positive credit mix and a relatively low outstanding debt. Your credit history age also played a beneficial role.  Conversely, factors like the number of credit inquiries and payment behavior (specifically,  your history of delayed payments) had a slightly negative influence but were ultimately outweighed by the positive aspects.
