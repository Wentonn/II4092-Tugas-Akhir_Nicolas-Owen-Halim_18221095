Hi Gerson, Your credit score result is "Standard".

The reason for your "Standard" classification is a combination of several factors.  Our model considers many aspects of your financial history, and some contribute more strongly to your score than others.  For example,  a positive influence on your score came from your relatively high Annual Income and a good interest rate on your existing loans.  Also, having a few credit cards and a moderate amount of outstanding debt positively impacted your score.

However, certain aspects could be improved to achieve a higher credit score.  Specifically,  your credit mix (the types of credit you have) and your payment history (specifically, the number of times you've been late) have been identified as areas impacting your current standing.  Finally, your spending level and the value of your recent transactions played a smaller role in your classification.

To improve your credit score in the future, we suggest focusing on these key areas:

**Option 1 (Counterfactual #1 & #3):** Improve your credit mix by diversifying the types of credit you use.  For example, if you mostly use credit cards, consider obtaining a loan.  Also, consider increasing your spending level to demonstrate responsible financial behaviour. Aim for a more moderate spending pattern than just low spending, which reflects more positively on your creditworthiness.  Finally, increase the value of your transactions gradually. This reflects more stability and shows a healthy financial management.


**Option 2 (Counterfactual #2 & #4):**  Reduce your overall debt.  This is a significant factor in credit scoring.  By lowering your total debt significantly, you can improve your score.  Likewise, decreasing your monthly expenses is very important. A lower monthly expense shows less financial burden and more financial responsibility. While increasing your investments will be challenging in the short term, it's definitely a good long term solution.


It's important to note that these are just suggestions, and the best approach will depend on your individual financial situation. We recommend carefully reviewing your financial standing and prioritizing whichever option suits your needs and resources.

Thank you for applying for credit with us. We hope you have a great day!
