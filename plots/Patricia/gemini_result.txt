Hi Patricia, Your credit score result is "Bad".

The reason for your "Bad" classification is multifaceted.  Several factors contributed to this assessment.  Specifically, your payment history played a significant role.  A history of delayed payments, indicated by a high "Delay_from_due_date", negatively impacted your score.  Furthermore, the number of credit inquiries ("Num_Credit_Inquiries") suggests you may have recently applied for multiple credit lines, which can sometimes be viewed negatively by lenders. Your "Credit_Mix", representing the variety of your credit accounts, also appears to be a factor.  Additionally, your "Outstanding_Debt" and "Credit_Utilization_Ratio" suggest you're utilizing a substantial portion of your available credit, which can also lower your creditworthiness.

To improve your credit score, we've identified several potential areas for improvement.  Based on our analysis, the following changes could help you achieve a better credit rating:

**Option 1:** This option focuses on improving your payment history and managing your debt. This requires several key changes in your financial behavior.  Reduce the frequency of delayed payments ("Delay_from_due_date" needs to be significantly lower).  It's also essential to significantly decrease your "Outstanding_Debt"  while also increasing your "Total_Debt". This signifies consistent and timely payments, eventually leading to a healthier credit history and a higher score.


**Option 2:** This option is more focused on responsible credit utilization. It suggests reducing the number of active credit accounts ("Num_Credit_Card"), which could improve your overall credit profile.  Simultaneously, increasing your monthly income ("Monthly_Inhand_Salary") and paying down existing debts could also lead to a positive shift.



**Option 3:**  This option is more aggressive, requiring a change in profession which could positively impact your credit score. Combined with a focus on consistently timely payments and improved debt management. This approach needs to be coupled with all the recommendations in the first option. 


Improving your credit score takes time and effort. However, by making conscious choices about managing your debt, improving your payment history, and maintaining a balanced credit portfolio, you can significantly improve your financial standing.  Remember, these are just suggestions, and itâ€™s always best to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
