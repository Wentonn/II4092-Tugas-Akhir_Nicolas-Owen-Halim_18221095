Hi Mike, Your credit score result is "Standard".

The reason for your standard credit score is a combination of several factors.  Our model indicates that your current credit mix and unemployment category are particularly influential.  Having a standard credit mix and a certain level of unemployment history have contributed to your current score.  Other factors such as your outstanding debt, interest rate, and payment history also play a role, though to a lesser extent. While some aspects of your financial profile are positive, others could be improved to achieve a higher credit score.

To improve your credit score to "Good", consider the following based on our analysis:

**Option 1 (Counterfactual #1):**  Slightly reducing your monthly in-hand salary and number of bank accounts while improving your credit mix to "Good" and changing your payment behavior to "No/NM" would significantly improve your creditworthiness.  Maintaining a healthy balance in your account would also help.  Reducing the number of your open bank accounts and improving your credit mix would suggest better financial management and credit responsibility.  Changing your payment behavior to "No/NM" (assuming this means "No Minimum Payment" or similar) indicates that you make full payments, not just minimums. While reducing income might seem counterintuitive, the model suggests that in combination with the other changes, it indicates better management of finances and lowers the perceived risk to lenders.

**Option 2 (Counterfactual #3 & #4):**  Reducing the number of your credit cards, lowering your changed credit limit, improving your credit mix to "Good", increasing your monthly balance and obtaining both a Credit-Builder Loan and a Mortgage Loan could also raise your credit score.  The model suggests that this signals improved financial stability and a stronger financial history, which leads to a higher credit score. Similarly, reducing the total number of loan applications shows greater responsibility.

It's important to note that these are suggestions. You should always consult with a financial advisor to personalize strategies for improving your credit score.
